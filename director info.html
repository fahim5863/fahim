On behalf of the Board of Directors of the National College of Education, Narsingdi,
        the best institution of the time in Narsingdi district,
        which has been transformed from an industrial city to an educational city, 
        I extend my warmest greetings and congratulations to everyone.
A few words for the students and conscious guardians seeking admission in the 2023-24 academic year.
Dear students, you have to be the bearers of a beautiful and successful generation,
        so that the green shoots of peace sprout on the soil where your light falls.
        The deeper and more compassionate the relationship between students and teachers,
        the more orderly and positive the mutual behavior will be. Life will be happier, 
        more satisfying and more worthwhile. This positive environment has been ensured 
        by the National College of Education.
The most important thing is: The guardian of this college is the well-known educationist
        Professor Golam Mustafa, Mia Sir. There is a visionary of establishing a private 
        college in Narsingdi district, the founder of this college and the president of the
        governing body, Professor Abu Taher Belal Sir, who is closely observing and teaching
        the subject-based teaching of the talented and smart directors of this college,
        as well as the keen care of all the activities of the college and there are more 
        than fifty full-time talented teachers.
Respected guardians, the peaceful environment of the educational institution accelerates 
        success, calms the mind and fills life with joy. In addition to raising your child
        to be a good citizen, the National College of Education will play a supporting role 
        in building a livable and peaceful happy world, InshaAllah. May everyone's path be 
        beautiful. Allah Hafez.
