       On behalf of the Board of Directors of the National College of Education, Narsingdi, the best institution of the time in Narsingdi district, which has been transformed from an industrial city to an educational city, I extend my warmest greetings and congratulations to everyone.
A few words for the students and conscious guardians seeking admission in the 2023-24 academic year.
        <br>
        Dear students, you have to be the bearers of a beautiful and successful generation, so that the green shoots of peace sprout on the soil where your light falls. The deeper and more compassionate the relationship between students and teachers, the more orderly and positive the mutual behavior will be. Life will be happier, more satisfying and more worthwhile. This positive environment has been ensured by the National College of Education.
